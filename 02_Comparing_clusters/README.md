# Comparing clusters

This folder contains R Markdown scripts for statistical analysis and visualization of subgroup differences across cognitive, environmental, and neural measures.

## Script Summaries

- **NMI_Ranking.Rmd**
Plots normalized mutual information (NMI) scores to rank feature importance across discovery and replication datasets.

- **comparing_clusters.Rmd**
Assesses differences across clusters within each data modality using linear models and ANOVAs, and generates visualizations.

- **boxplot_visualizations.Rmd**
Creates box plots to visualize differences in cognitive and environmental measures across clusters with non-PLE reference group.

- **Cluster-NonPLE_comparison.Rmd**
For brain imaging data only: Compares clusters to nonPLE reference group using t-test, extracts effect sizes

- **Effect_Size_Plotting.Rmd**
Creates brain plots and heatmaps to visualize neural effect sizes (t-statistics) comparing clusters with non-PLE group.
