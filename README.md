### Project Overview
This repository contains R Markdown scripts for processing, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal data—including neural, cognitive, and environmental metrics—to identify subgroups of youth with distressing psychotic-like experiences.

## Script Summaries
- **Effect_Size_Plotting.Rmd**
Creates brain plots and heatmaps to visualize neural effect sizes (t-statistics) comparing clusters with nonPLE group.

- **NMI_Ranking.Rmd**
Plots normalized mutual information (NMI) scores to rank feature importance across discovery and replication datasets.

- **Similarity_Matrix.Rmd**
Visualizes participant-level similarity matrices derived from SNF, annotated by data-driven group labels for both discovery and replication samples.

- **Longitudinal_Analysis_PLE.Rmd**
Performs longitudinal trajectory modeling of Total PLE scores across baseline, Year 1, and Year 2 using LCGA and GMM.
